## Required Material

Before starting the course for the fall semester, I would highly recommend review the pre-req material for the course on the syllabus. Given the shortened semester, please make sure that you are 100 percent comfortable with the pre-req material before taking STA 490/690. If you have any questions regarding this, please reach out to me as soon as possible. Specifically, please be sure to review STA 360/602 if you feel rusty with any components from this course. If you have not learned maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), I would ask that you learn this before the first day of class.
